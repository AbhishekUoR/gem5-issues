# gem5-issues

Completely unofficial gem5 issue tracker https://github.com/gem5/gem5 , the mailing list is the only official one: http://gem5.org/Mailing_Lists Request for official GitHub tracker was declined: https://github.com/cirosantilli-work/gem5-issues/issues/3 go upvote that and ping the mailing list thread if you want it.

Maintained on a best effort basis, I will try to label, reproduce and close bugs reported.

Anyone is welcome to open bugs here, but they will likely not be seen by any devs except me.

For usage questions, prefer the Stack Overflow gem5 tag: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gem5 although it will also likely not be seen by the other main devs currently either.

Double posting here in addition to the official tracker is encouraged.
