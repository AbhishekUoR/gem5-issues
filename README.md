# gem5-issues

Completely unofficial gem5 issue tracker https://github.com/gem5/gem5 , the mailing list is the only official one: http://gem5.org/Mailing_Lists Maintained on a best effort basis. Anyone is welcome to open bugs here, but they will likely not be seen by any devs except me. Double posting here in addition to the official tracker is encouraged.
